How the tax Check process fits into the Escrow and Title Search process when buying a property
Here’s a simplified overview of how the **tax check process** fits into the escrow and title search process when buying a property:

### 1. **Property Tax Search**:
   - As part of the title search, the **escrow agent** or **title examiner** checks the property’s tax status with local tax authorities.
   - This involves looking up the property in **county tax records** to see if there are any **outstanding taxes** or **delinquent payments** (unpaid taxes) from the current or previous owners.

### 2. **Assessing Property Tax Liens**:
   - If any unpaid property taxes are found, they may result in a **tax lien** on the property. A tax lien means the local government has a claim on the property until the taxes are paid.
   - The **title company** notes any existing tax liens in the title report as an **exception** (something that must be addressed before closing).

### 3. **Verifying Tax Status for Clear Title**:
   - Ensuring that all property taxes are paid is essential for delivering a **clear title** to the buyer, which means there are no outstanding claims or issues with the property.
   - If there are any unpaid taxes or liens, they must be resolved (paid off) by the seller before or at closing to prevent the buyer from inheriting these obligations.

### 4. **Calculating Property Taxes at Closing**:
   - The **escrow agent** will calculate the property tax amount due based on the **closing date**. Taxes may need to be prorated (split between buyer and seller based on when the sale occurs).
   - This means the seller may owe a portion of the taxes up to the closing date, and the buyer takes responsibility from that date forward.

### 5. **Collecting and Paying Property Taxes**:
   - At closing, the **escrow agent** may collect any remaining tax payments as part of the **closing costs**.
   - The collected funds are then used to pay the tax authority to ensure the property is tax-clear at the time of transfer.

### 6. **Adding Property Taxes to Escrow**:
   - If the buyer’s loan requires an escrow account for taxes and insurance, the **lender** might include monthly tax payments in the buyer’s mortgage. The lender will then pay these taxes to the tax authority on the buyer’s behalf.

In summary, the tax check process is crucial in identifying unpaid taxes or liens that could affect ownership. By ensuring all taxes are paid at closing, the escrow agent and title company make sure the buyer gets a clear title without outstanding tax-related issues.
